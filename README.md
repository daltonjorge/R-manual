# R-manual

An introductory guide, with examples, for doing basic tasks and statistical tests in R. The manual is written in Rmarkdown and outputs to a single html file. Topics include:

* Basic commands
* Importing data
* Sampling
* Descriptive stats
* Basic plots
* t-tests
* ANOVA
* Regression
* Chi-square tests

The manual is based on tutorials I have [previously written](https://github.com/kenkellner/R-tutorials), and was originally developed for an experimental R-based section of Elementary Statistical Methods (STAT 301) that I taught at Purdue University.
